# Movie-ticket-management-system
  In our project we showed how to reserve a seat to watch a movie usinh the concepts of C++. This code allowed users to view, book and cancel the seats for the movies that were schduled per week. 
  The following features were used in our program: 
  
  1. SEAT DISPLAY: Availabilty of seats iss represenated with "-" whereas reserved seats are represented with "R".  
  
  2. MOVIE SELECTION: Choose any movie you want to watch available on each day. 
  
  3. SEAT RESERVATION: You can reserve any seat to watch movie of your own choice. 
  
  4. SEAT RESERVATION AND CANCELATION: You can reserve seats and then cancel them if you don't want to watch any movie or want to book another seat.
  
  5. ERROR HANDLING: Ensures that valid row,coloumn, days and movies are entered.
